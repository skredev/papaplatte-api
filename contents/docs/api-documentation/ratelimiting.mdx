  Rate limiting only applies to requests on the `papaplatte-api.skre.dev` domain
</Note>

Our system implements a rate limiting policy to ensure the stability and performance of the service.

## Request Rate Limit

The current rate limit is configured to allow 1 request every 500 milliseconds. This means that a client is permitted to send a new request only after 500 milliseconds have passed since the last request.
